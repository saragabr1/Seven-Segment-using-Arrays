# Arduino Seven-Segment Counter
This is an Arduino program that uses arrays to count from 0 to 9 on a seven-segment display. The program is written in C++ and can be uploaded to an Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

# Requirements
To run this program, you will need:

- An Arduino board (such as the Arduino Uno)
- A seven-segment display
- Jumper wires
- A breadboard (optional)
# Installation
To install this program on your Arduino board, follow these steps:

1. Connect the seven-segment display to your Arduino board using jumper wires. Refer to the comments in the code for the pin connections.

2. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.

3. Copy and paste the code from seven_segment_counter.ino into the new sketch.

4. Verify the code by clicking on the "Verify" button in the Arduino IDE.

5. Upload the code to your Arduino board by clicking on the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE.

6. The seven-segment display should now start counting from 0 to 9.

# Usage
The program is set up to count from 0 to 9 and display each number for 1 second. You can modify the program to change the counting sequence or the display duration.
